   The Raspberry Pi Foundation started by a handful of volunteers in 2012
   when they released the original Raspberry Pi 256MB Model B without knowing
   what to expect. In a short four-year period they have grown to over sixty
   full-time employees and have shipped over eight million units to-date.
   Raspberry Pi has achieved new heights by being shipped to the
   International Space Station for research and by being an affordable
   computing platforms used by teachers throughout the world. "It has become
   the all-time best-selling computer in the UK".

   you should use a recent 32-bit NOOBS or Raspbian image from their
   downloads page with a promise of a switch to a 64-bit version only if
