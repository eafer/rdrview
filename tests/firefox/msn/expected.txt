   Insider Inc Nintendo/Apple Nintendo and Apple shocked the world earlier
   this year by announcing "Super Mario Run," the legendary gaming company's
   first foray into mobile gaming. It's a Mario game you can play on your
   phone with just one hand, so what's not to love?

   Thankfully, now we know when you can get it and for how much: "Super Mario
   Run" will launch on iPhone and iPad on December 15, for a flat fee of
   $9.99. You can play a sample of the game modes for free, but unlike most
   other mobile games that let you download for free but require money to
   keep playing, or access parts of the game, you can pay $10 to get
   everything right away.

   In case you haven't heard, "Super Mario Run" is essentially a regular,
   side-scrolling "Super Mario" game with one key difference: You don't
   control Mario's movement. He runs automatically and all you do is tap the
   screen to jump.

   The name and basic idea might sound like one of those endless score attack
   games like "Temple Run," but that's not the case. "Super Mario Run" is
   divided into hand-crafted levels with a clear end-point like any other
   Mario game, meaning you're essentially getting the Mario experience for
   $10 without needing to control his movement.

   $10 might seem like a bit much compared to the $0 people pay for most
   mobile games, but it's possible the game has $10 worth of levels to play
   in it. It's also not iPhone exclusive, but the Android version will launch
   at a later, currently unknown date.
